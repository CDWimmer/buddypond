- no_chat_messages being hid globally instead of local per user

- ensure youtube players player.stop() on close window event ( not minimize event )

- fix HTML injection by using jQuery.text on nodes
  - use css class and .text() instead of string concats
- add emojis to chat ( utf-8 support)

- add min display time to loading gifs ( to avoid flicker )
- fix scroll top issue with console output ( scroll to bottom like chat )

- create icons for connected / disconnected

1/2 - rig up console to show events ( div instead of textarea )

- add midi fighter pad with sound fx
  - goose sound effect
  

1/2 - investigate local yt player not working for certain videos?
  - file:// only 
  
  issue seems related to specific youtube ids not working on file://
  current work-around is to use http server for localhost
  possible work-around for local is to destroy and remove youtube iframe per video load
  this will mean not using loadVideoById, but instead injecting new frame per video
  mtvPlayer.loadVideoById('1m-KtU88K9Y')
  mtvPlayer.loadVideoById('pNGEqGvz-ds')

After the Babel Project's NPM dependency tower falls the only logical conclusion will be for developers to build simulated Windows 95 Desktops with jQuery.

This is the way. Use Lua and Luv.it to achieve Utopia HTTP routing.
