1/2 - rig up console to show events ( div instead of textarea )

- add midi fighter pad with sound fx
  - goose sound effect
- add simple paint app
- add simple notes
- add fx to mirror app ( finish basic mirror app )

? - add min display time to loading gifs ( to avoid flicker )

1/2 - investigate local yt player not working for certain videos?
  - file:// only 
  issue seems related to specific youtube ids not working on file://
  current work-around is to use http server for localhost
  possible work-around for local is to destroy and remove youtube iframe per video load
  this will mean not using loadVideoById, but instead injecting new frame per video
  mtvPlayer.loadVideoById('1m-KtU88K9Y')
  mtvPlayer.loadVideoById('pNGEqGvz-ds')

X - enter events for joining pond by custom name
X - connect up window_pond_message ( copy and paste getMessage / sendMessage code for now, its not the same for ponds )

X - emoji inputs not clearing text after send, missing click input cursor
X - adjust emoji picker css and placement for buddy send message

X - add client-side render for approve / deny buddy ( hide link)
X - add logout link
X - add login / logout links to toolbar
X - add loading / waiting for add first buddy
XX - add login UX for splash ( matrix style something if pos )

X - fix UX around no buddies / pending buddies ( remove no buddies if pending )
X - add UX error for when login password is fail
X - add UX error handler for when server is down on login
X - add ability to recover from failed connection

X - fix styling on date time chat and set chat name colors
  X - backbg with green text?

X - convert window_buddy_message_0 into function to generate N chat windows ( cap at 10 for now )
X - fix default size of buddy list ( more vertie less hortie )

After the Babel Project's NPM dependency tower falls the only logical conclusion will be for developers to build simulated Windows 95 Desktops with jQuery.

This is the way. Use Lua and Luv.it to achieve Utopia HTTP routing.
